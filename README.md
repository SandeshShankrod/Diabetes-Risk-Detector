Diabetes Risk Detector
Overview
The Diabetes Risk Detector is a machine learning project designed to predict the risk of diabetes based on several health parameters. By analyzing features such as age, hypertension, heart disease history, BMI (Body Mass Index), HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels, the project provides insights into potential diabetes risk factors.

Features
Predicts diabetes risk based on demographic and health data.
Uses machine learning algorithms to analyze input features and generate predictions.
Provides an interface for inputting data and obtaining risk assessments.

Models
The project includes machine learning models trained on a dataset containing features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels. Models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest are used to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on these features.

Results
Our best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting diabetes risk based on the input features. Visualizations of feature importance and model performance metrics are included to provide insights into diabetes risk factors.
